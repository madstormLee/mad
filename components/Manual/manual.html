This is manual for Manual.

But I dont want waste my time.
You must guess how use this manual.
simply, if you send id to manual/view, manual check it exists or not.
if exists, show you manual, or you will see this page.

Now, you requests <b><?=$g->get->id?></b> page.
Yes. Manual don't have any page <b><?=$g->get->id?></b>.
Use below component navigation.
